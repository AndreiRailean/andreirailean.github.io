# Andrei Railean

**Principal Engineer | Platform Architect | Engineering Mentor | Fostering Team Excellence and Innovation at Ignition**

Byron Bay, NSW Australia | hello@andrei.md | https://andrei.md

Came to Australia in 2000 to study Computer Science at UNSW in Sydney and never left. I have been helping companies build software systems ever since. Experienced different environments and business models: web agencies and consulting, online publishers, e-commerce and SaaS products. Have maintained hands-on engineering skills even while working in management roles and building teams - this allowed me to bridge the gap between technical and other kinds of knowledge workers.

I focus on developing collaborative engineering teams that know how to build software that is maintainable and scales well. I am not afraid of difficult conversations or asking "stupid" questions.

#### Co-Founder and Frontend Engineer | Jul 2013 - May 2014
I co-founded AnyPrice to build a price comparison engine for consumer products in a google-like manner - by collecting information from the open web. We built software to collect, categorize, group, display and otherwise make sense of terabytes of data.

Business achieved good traction with Google and visitors. Our audience was able to conveniently explore all options available on the market, unlike at other pay-to-play comparison websites.

The business was shut down because we were overcapitalized on SEO and when Google changed the algorithm, our traffic tanked and we ran out of money.
