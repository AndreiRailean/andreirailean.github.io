            Full-stack web engineer building rich <b>ES6 JavaScript</b> applications using <b>React</b>, <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>ElasticSearch</b> &mdash; all connected with modern <b>APIs</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been in the web space for 20 years. I've built and maintained content management systems, REST APIs, web scrapers, databases, search engines, dashboards, user management systems, online shops and other web-based interfaces and tools. I have a strong understanding of search engine optimisation principles and good experience in using it to gain advantage in google rankings.
          </p>
          <p>
            My ops-foo is not strong, but I'm comfortable working with many aspects of <b>Amazon Web Services</b> platform, from setting up EC2 instances and load balancers to configuring DNS in Route 53 and CDN in CloudFront. AWS is the cloud provider where I have most experience as a developer with a bit of devops skill. <b>Docker</b> is a technology I'm experimenting with.
          </p>
          <h2>Mentoring and Code Reviews</h2>
          <p>
            If you have written some code and want a second pair of eyes to go through it, don't hesitate to reach out. I've been around the block and can spot poorly written code and identify where it may cause problems in the future both at run-time and during maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
             If you have questions about how to tackle a particular problem with software, <b>I'm happy to provide my input and feedback</b>. Two heads are better than one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Happy to mentor new developers or those considering becoming a techie. You may have questions about choosing a tech stack or deciding what your next career move should be. Send your questions by email or via twitter.
          </p>
          <h2>Startups</h2>
          <p>
            I have experience launching a few startups and know what's involved in setting up and running one. If you have an idea for a startup, feel free to get in touch. I can provide feedback on your idea and give you helpful pointers for next steps. 9 out of 10 startups fail - you need all the help you can get.
          </p>
          <h2>Tech Interests</h2>
          <p>
            Often, you can find me experimenting with the Internet of Things (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/iot">IoT</a>). I try to get microcontrollers and tiny computers to read sensors and talk to one another.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my latest experiments i've worked with Onion Omega, C.H.I.P and RaspberryPi small computers. I got them talking to each other via MQTT to send sensor data around.
