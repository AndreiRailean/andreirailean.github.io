    New Apple TV
  </h3>

  <p>
    Got myself a brand new Apple TV (4 Gen). The guys at Apple have reworked the UI and made the whole experience a lot slicker. My favourite feature so far is being able to control TV volume and turn on the tv from the AppleTV remote. Doesn't take much to make me happy. I intend to try making Apple TV helpful in my IoT experiments. Will try writing an app to see how much of a hub it can become for other devices in the house.
